          <h4>TOKYO GHOUL</h4>

          <p>
            The story follows Ken Kaneki, a student who barely survives a deadly
            encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a
            ghoul and tries to eat him. He is taken to the hospital in critical
            condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a
            surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was
            accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his
            body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to
            survive. Ghouls who run a coffee shop called "Anteiku" (あんていく)
            take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul.
            Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society,
            as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions,
            especially from his best friend, Hideyoshi Nagachika. The prequel
            series Tokyo Ghoul [Jack] follows the youths of Kishō Arima and
            Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become
            acquainted when they join forces to investigate the death of
            Taishi's friend at the hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi
            eventually following Arima's path and joining the CCG (Commission of
            Counter Ghoul), the federal agency tasked into dealing with crimes
            related to ghouls as well. The sequel series Tokyo Ghoul:re follows
            an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity of Haise Sasaki (the
            result of horrific brain damage sustained from Kishō Arima). He is
            the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators called "Quinx
            Squad" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing them to
            obtain the special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them but
            still being able to live as normal humans.

            <h4>Death Note</h4>
            <p>
              In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami
              finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook that can kill
              anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face.
              Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the
              possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile
              Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five
              days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a
              "shinigami" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible
              to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he
              dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is
              amused by Light's actions.[5] As criminals around the world die
              from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media
              suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious
              murders and name them "Kira" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration
              of the word "killer"). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests
              the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L,
              to assist their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in
              Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto
              region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious,
              Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L
              deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police
              investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under
              the suspicion that "Kira" could have family ties with members of
              the "Kira" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to
              monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and
              L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around
              this time, Light graduates from high school to college.

            <h4>Spy x Family</h4>
            <p>
              In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations
              of Westalis and Ostania,[a] a Westalian agent code-named
              "Twilight" is tasked with spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the
              National Unity Party within Ostania. However, due to Desmond being
              notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him
              is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons
              and pose as a fellow parent. To accomplish this and present the
              image of a happy family, he creates the alias of Loid Forger,
              adopts a young orphan girl named Anya, and marries a woman named
              Yor Briar. However, unbeknownst to him Anya can read minds and Yor
              is in fact a professional assassin. Neither Loid nor Yor are aware
              of each other's true identities, or that Anya knows their true
              professions. The family later takes in a dog with precognitive
              abilities whom they name Bond. Despite these unknown factors and
              Twilight's occasional lapses of common sense due to years of being
              a spy, he must learn to play the role of the perfect father and
              husband in order to carry out his mission.

            <h4>Darling in the Franxx</h4>
            <p>
              In a post-apocalyptic world, humanity is pushed to the brink of
              extinction by the constant threat of giant creatures known as
              klaxosaurs (叫竜, kyoryū), which are subdivided into at least four
              categories based on their size: "Conrad",[d] "Mohorovičić",[e]
              "Gutenberg"[f] and "(Super) Lehmann".[g] Parasites are raised to
              pilot giant mecha known as Franxx[h] (フランキス, Furankisu) in
              boy-girl pairs. A male parasite is termed a "stamen", and a female
              parasite is referred to as a "pistil" (the male and female
              reproductive parts of a flower, respectively). Parasites are
              artificially created and have short lifespans. A team of ten
              parasites is assigned to the experimental Squad 13 of Plantation
              13. One of them, Hiro (Code:016), is a former pilot-candidate
              prodigy who can no longer synchronize with his partner, and they
              both fail to complete the training program. While skipping his
              squad's graduation ceremony, Hiro encounters Zero Two (Code:002),
              an elite Franxx pilot with klaxosaur blood, red horns, and an
              infamous reputation as the "Partner Killer". It is rumored that
              Zero Two's partners are killed after pairing with her by the third
              time. Shortly after, a Klaxosaur attacks, disrupting Hiro's
              graduation ceremony and leaving Zero Two's partner killed in
              action. Despite the rumors, Hiro volunteers to become her new
              partner, or as Zero Two calls him, her "darling".

            <h4>From Me to You</h4>
            <p>
              The story takes place in Hokkaido. 15-year-old high school
              freshman Sawako Kuronuma—dubbed Sadako by her classmates for her
              resemblance to the character from The Ring—has always been feared
              and misunderstood because of her appearance. Rumors around school
              report that she can see ghosts and curse people. However, despite
              her ominous appearance, she is actually a sweet and unassuming
              girl who only longs to be helpful. She has been shunned for so
              long that the idea of making friends has become foreign to her.
              When a popular boy, Kazehaya, begins talking with her, everything
              changes. She finds herself in a new world, making new friends and
              talking to different people, and she can't thank Kazehaya enough
              for giving her these opportunities. Slowly, but surely, a sweet
              love blossoms between the two as they overcome circumstances and
              obstacles standing in their way.
